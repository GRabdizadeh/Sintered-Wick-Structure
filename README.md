# Sintered-Wick-Structure
Code Overview
This repository contains the geometry generation and numerical simulation codes for sintered wick structures. The main features include:

Geometry Generation
Three primary configurations of sintered wick structures are generated:

Irregular Structure: This configuration mimics real-world sintered wick structures and features randomized particle sizes and spatial arrangements. It is designed to capture the inherent stochasticity of practical applications and analyze the impact of natural porosity variations on permeability and fluid flow behavior.
Regular Structure with Uniform Particle Size: This configuration assumes a fixed particle size, allowing for the study of how geometric uniformity influences flow behavior and permeability.
Regular Grid Structure: Particles are arranged in a uniform grid with fixed size, providing insights into the effects of geometric symmetry and simplified structures on flow dynamics.
Numerical Simulations with COMSOL
Numerical simulations are performed using COMSOL Multiphysics to analyze permeability and fluid flow dynamics across the generated structures. The simulation framework is designed to support the investigation of key parameters such as particle arrangement, pore size, and overall structural properties.

Irregular Domain
The Irregular Domain configuration aims to replicate the randomness and variability found in real sintered wick structures. By incorporating random particle sizes and spatial distributions, it provides valuable insights into how natural variations in porosity influence permeability and fluid behavior.

Access and Usage
The codes and associated files are available in this repository and include pre-configured files for direct execution in COMSOL. This repository serves as a foundational framework for researchers working on similar projects.
